# Code-Samples
Some things I have coded for school, work, or personal projects.

For some of the school coding projects, I was given a framework where I just had to code some of the functions.

School Projects:
CS470 Intro to AI, 
Python Ray Tracer, 
CS345 Operating System Design

Work:
Unity C# Scripts/NumberNinjitsu

Personal Project:
Unity C# Scripts/PersonalGameProject
